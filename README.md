# Driversâ€™ Route Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing drivers' routes in the logistics and merchandise transport sector using data mining techniques. The goal is to improve efficiency by generating data to simulate a fictitious company's standard routes, identifying preferred routes for individual drivers, and creating ideal routes tailored to each driver's preferences. The project leverages clustering, recommendation systems, and frequent itemset mining to achieve these objectives.

## Key Features
1. **Recommended Standard Routes**: Generates a new set of standard routes based on drivers' actual routes, improving adherence to company-provided instructions.
2. **Five Preferred Routes for Each Driver**: Identifies the top five standard routes that each driver is most likely to follow, based on their historical travel patterns.
3. **Ideal Standard Route for Each Driver**: Constructs a personalized standard route for each driver, tailored to their preferences and historical behavior.

## Implementation Details
### 1. **Recommended Standard Routes**
- **Clustering**: Actual routes are clustered using K-Means, with the number of clusters equal to the number of standard routes.
- **Centroid Extraction**: The centroids of each cluster are used to generate recommended standard routes.
- **Evaluation**: The clustering quality is assessed using the Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Score. The recommended routes are evaluated by comparing their performance to the original standard routes.

### 2. **Five Preferred Routes for Each Driver**
- **Preferences Object**: A `Preferences` object is created for each driver, summarizing their historical routes, frequent cities, trips, and merchandise.
- **Similarity Calculation**: The similarity between each standard route and the driver's preferences is computed, and the top five routes with the highest similarity are selected.
- **Evaluation**: The robustness of the method is tested by comparing the results from a training set to those from a test set.

### 3. **Ideal Standard Route for Each Driver**
- **Route Construction**: An ideal route is constructed based on the driver's preferences, prioritizing frequent trips, cities, and merchandise.
- **Evaluation**: The ideal route is tested by comparing it to the driver's updated preferences after incorporating new data.
